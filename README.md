# SeriesCountdown

SeriesCountdown is an Open Source Android application that allows you to check when will the next episode of your favorite series be available.

It was mainly created for testing all the new goodies that the new Support libraries brought us, and finally ended being an useful application.

SeriesCountdown gets all the information from the web [EpisoDate](https://www.episodate.com/), whose owner was so nice that, when knew that I was doing it by scrapping, offered me a very nice API so I could get the information more easily.
